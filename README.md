# Fashion Product Recommendation System ðŸ‘—ðŸ§¥ðŸ‘•

This project is a deep learning-based content-based image recommendation system that suggests similar fashion items based on an input image. It leverages a pretrained CNN model (ResNet50) and uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for visual similarity search.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The goal is to help users discover visually similar fashion products by uploading an image. This can be used in e-commerce platforms to improve user experience and product discovery.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow / Keras** â€“ For feature extraction using ResNet50
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ KNN algorithm for nearest neighbor search
- **Streamlit** â€“ To build the web-based user interface
- **Python** â€“ Core development language

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. User uploads a fashion item image.
2. The CNN model extracts visual features from the image.
3. KNN compares these features with the dataset.
4. Top 5 visually similar products are displayed as recommendations.
